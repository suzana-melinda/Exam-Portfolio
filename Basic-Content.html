           <h2>Group Project</h2>
           <p>The last theme of the first semester was more focused on the team project.</p>
       <p>Using all that we have learned during the first semester we had to create a campaign site for FoodSharing Copenhagen.</p>
       <p>The requirements included: addressing one of the two issues presented (we chose to educate people to reduce food waste.) a video for the campaign site and another short video for social media.</p></div>
       
       
  <div class="video">
       <h2>Video production â€“ Fruit positivity</h2>
     
        <p>In order to produce the video we had to fist create a Treatment  that contains Title, Theme
And Logline. Next step was to create the Storyboard. After that has been approved we began the production of the video.
</p>
       <p>Using the material that we had we wrote the lines for the actors. During the filming process we changed some of the ideas that we first began with as we found it more suitable this way. </p>
      <p>The video was edited using Premiere Pro.

</p>
      <p>For the social media video we had to thing of something short but effective so we filmed a boomerang. </p>

  <div class="site">
       
       <h2>Campaign site production</h2>
      
      <p>
For the website we chose a simple layout, the first part contained a quote followed by the video and finally we added some tips on how people can reduce food waste at home since that is where the most of this is happening.

       <h2>Customer Pitch </h2>
       
      <p>The last task that we had after we finalized our work was to present it in front of the customer. I believe this was a really good experience for me to improve my presentation skills and considering the fact that we did this for a real organization and addressing directly to the representatives of Foodsharing Copenhagen and teachers.</p>

      <h2>My overall experience</h2>
      <p> This was my favorite project of all semester, not only that we had the opportunity to work with a real organization but also because we believed in their couse. Since we have been introduced to them we changed our way of seeing food and we are more aware of how we consume it for sure. I also apply all the tips that we presented on our campaign site.   </p>
