      <p>In this research we accumulated data about the how students are interacting with KEA's campus. Our first assumption was that they are not that familiar with all buildings. An other objective was to find out what other facilities the students want. </p>
      <p>The questionnaire consisted in 11 questions that contained at the begining demographic questions followed by questions regarding the location of the campus on were are they studying. The 11 steps of the questionnaire included of open ended, close ended, multiple choie and scale questionsquestions </p>

       <h2>Prototype</h2>

<p>One of this chapter’s assignment was to build an XD high fidelity prototype of a website using a UI kit, which helps new international students in Copenhagen finding accommodation, a job and a social network. </p>

<p>Our first task was to research on conventions in regards to design, content and functionality, and then create a digital solution.
We decided to focus on the accommodation finder topic however in our solution we also suggested that the other 2 topics are covered by the site but we didn’t developed them further. </p>

      <p>To test this prototype we used the “think out load test” the results and full report can be downloaded   <a href="http://smv-is-online.com/Portfolio/semester1/material/030201_Content-production_Zsuzsanna.pdf"> here.</a></p>
