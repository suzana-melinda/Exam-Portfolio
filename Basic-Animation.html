       <h2>Animation on a background</h2>
      
      <p>First assignment of this theme was to create an animation on a background. Furthermore the requirements consisted in design one or more characters and to describe their goal , social background behavior etc.</p>     
      <p>For the characters and for the background Adobe Illustrator was used.</p>
      <p>It was definitely a fun project that I enjoyed working on. </p>
      <p>The main character is Syrene the chatbot and the sidekick Shiny the sea star. </p>
      <p>More details of the process and the hero’s story of the can be found here.

       <h2>Javascript controlled animation</h2>
       <p>The second project consisted in creating a Javascript controlled animationwhere the user can turn ten different css animations for your characer on and off.</p>  
        <p>For me this was the most challenging assignment of this semester, it was the first time that I have used JS. Even though I have struggled with the coding I have managed to create the animation. </p>
      <p>I wanted to give life to Shiny this time, as he was not that detailed in the first assignment.
For the animation I have used gifs and an animated SVG for the border. Also sounds were added to instruct the user.

       <h2>The Danish Experience Onboarding Game</h2>
       </div>
       <div class="team-text"><p>The final Project for the Basic Animation theme was a group project that requereid to create an interactive, animated, web based onboarding sequence that through gamification explains an important aspect about moving to Denmark to be a student on KEA multimedia design.
 <p>The concern that we addressed was navigating in Danish culture. In order to accomplish that we created Jonas a sidekick character that introduces the user into the Danish culture. 
We started by creating our team’s canvas where everybody addressed their concerns and personal goals. We decided to challenge ourselves and to try to work on improving our weaknesses. For me it was to improve my JavaScript coding knowledge. , then we designed the moodboard, personas collage and style tile for our onboarding game. Last but not least we created the storyboard to have a bigger picture of what we were about to develop.
</p>
           <p>In the first scene of the game, the user is being introduced to Jonas that acts like a guide for the player. At the begging he presents himself then they had of to the food market were the user learns about Danish food. After these scenes they decide to explore the Black Diamond were the player can learn more about Danish traditions / phrases and monarchy. </p>

  <div class="team-text-2">
        
       
        <p>In order for the user to finish the game he/ she has to pass a test were all questions have to be answered correctly. The reason why we decided to do this was to make sure that the students will learn something before getting the reward. </p> 
      <p>The reward consists in being a Danish expert and an invitation to a concert from the new friends.</p>

<p>This was one of my favorite project as I had to work with my team mates. It was a really good experience for me.
