  <h2>Moodboard of the given style</h2>
    <p>The first assignment from the Basic Web theme was to create a Moodboard of the given style (Art Deco).</p>   
<p>In order to create it, a research was made to find what characterizes the style. </p>      
<p>The moodboard was created in Adobe Photoshop using the basic tools such as the selection, crop and resize tools structured on layers. </p>   
<p>I really enjoyed working on this assignment since Art Deco is one of my favorite styles.</p>

    <h2>The process</h2>  
    <p>The next phase of the project was to make a further research on the subject and gather content for the website such as articles, images and examples. Another task was to create a logo.</p> 
    <p>For the logo Adobe Illustrator was used. It was the first time when I have used it. At the beginning I had some trouble with it but with time I got better at it.</p>
      
    <p>After gathering all the content the next task was to create my very first mobile website, using basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>  
    <p> During this theme I have also learn some design principles and have been introduces to Adobe color wheel. Even though I had some knowledge of color and basic coding this was new information to me and it changed my perspective.</p>

  <div class="text-prototype"> <h2>Prototype and Usability test</h2>
   <p>
After finalizing the first web page another assignment was to make an interactive prototype in Adobe XD. It was my first time interacting with this program, it definitely helped to save time and test it.
</p>
      
      <p>Another useful tool that I have learned was the CSS Grid layout. Until then I was not familiar with it. </p>
      
      <p>
The Testing phase consisted in performing the “Trunk Test” in order to have a better insight and to make it more user friendly.

      <h2>Final Results</h2>
      <p>Based on the results of the test I have made some changes such as making sure the user knows on witch page has landed by highlighting the navigation bar, some of the sections have been reorganized and started the coding process.</p>
      <p>For the home and design pages, the css grid it was used.</p>
